Hello everyone,
recently I became interested in game-hacking and started learning the fundamentals of CE and made a vanilla WoW trainer.

Features
Movement speed
Swim / flight speed
Jump Boost
Fly Mode
Infinite Jump
Anti-Root
Slow Fall
NoClip + Flight
Anti-Slow
Hill Climb
Walk Underwater
Predefined teleportation
Custom teleportation

Testing
It has been tested on my own private server and TurtleWoW.

Note
Some cheats are marked with * which means they are very risky to use and might get you banned.
Some teleport locations don't work because I was too lazy to get them manually.
